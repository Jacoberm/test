/* NAND device addressing and lookup ================================= */

/* NAND devices are addressed by name and, where appropriate, by
 * a numeric partition within the device.
 *
 * To look up a device, you must know its name. Names are defined
 * statically by the platform HAL along with the device's function
 * pointers etc.
 *
 * To actually use a NAND device, you must address your requests to 
 * a partition on it. These can be retrieved, given the device struct,
 * by cyg_nand_get_partition. (You are recommended not to directly
 * access the partitions array within the device struct, in case the
 * mechanism should change in future.)
 *
 * Note that partitions are numbered starting from 0, unlike
 * traditional hard drive partitions.
 */

/* Looks up a device, by name. If necessary, the device driver is
 * initialised and the device interrogated as to its capabilities.
 *
 * On success, stores a pointer to the device struct in *dev_o (if non-null) 
 * and returns 0.
 * Otherwise, returns a negative error code.

 * or the requested number is invalid.
